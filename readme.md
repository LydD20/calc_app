# Homework 6
## Environment Variables, Logging, & Continous Integration
- Added GitHub action by copying Professor Williams's .github folder and python-app.yml file
- Loaded environment variables from .env files. I left .env out of .gitignore so grader can see it was created
- Added logging for better understanding behavior and execution of program
